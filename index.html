                <h2>The First Few Classes</h2>
                <h3>Some Initial Thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                  I'm excited to learn HTML and CSS mostly because I'm really interested in JavaScript and know I need to learn the basics before I learn how to make interactive web pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My background is in architecture and public art and I have helped produce interactive sculptures all over the country that use hardware like Arduino and Raspberry Pi to engage audiences.  However, my background is not in coding so I have a lot to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first few classes have been not too challenging for me because I've already done a lot of experimenting on Treehouse and Codecademy prior to starting the class, but I know nothing about Git or Unix so those parts of the class have been really helpful.

                <p>
                  Figuring out the margins and floats for CSS has been challenging this week.  I haven't tried it yet, but I came across this cool script that converts Adobe Illustrator files into HTML and CSS.  This could save me time in the future as my background is in design and I'm very comfortable with Illustrator.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The script is called <a href="http://ai2html.org/">ai2html.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Last week I talked about how I'm really excited about JavaScript.  One thing I want to do eventually is learn how to program hardware in JS, using something like the <a href="https://tessel.io/">Tessel</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">Johnny-five framework</a>.
